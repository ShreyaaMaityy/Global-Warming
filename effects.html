            <h2>EFFECT OF GLOBAL WARMING </h2>
            <br>
            <img class="effect" src="/E2.jpg" alt="">
            <p> <b> Global warming has a number of negative effects on the environment, including:</b> <br>
                <br>
                <b>Climate change: </b> Rising temperatures are causing changes in climate patterns, leading to more
                frequent
                and severe weather events such as droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and floods. <br>
                <br>

                <b>Melting of glaciers: </b> As temperatures rise, glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, which can
                lead to
                rising sea levels and flooding in coastal areas. <br>
                <br>

                <b>Extinction of species: </b> Changes in temperature and weather patterns can cause species to migrate
                or go
                extinct, disrupting entire ecosystems. <br>
                <br>

                <b>Health impacts: </b> Increasing heat waves can cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and rising air
                pollution can worsen respiratory illnesses. <br>
                <br>

                <b> Agricultural impacts:</b> Changes in weather patterns can affect crop yields and lead to food
                shortages and
                price spikes. <br>
                <br>

                <b>Ocean acidification:</b> The ocean absorbs about one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted by human
                activities, which makes the water more acidic and threatens the survival of many marine species. <br>
                <br>

                <b>Economic impacts: </b> Global warming can lead to costly damages to infrastructure, property, and
                resources,
                as well as increased costs for adapting to the changing climate. <br>
                <br>

              <b>Increased frequency and intensity of wildfires: </b>  Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns are
                making wildfires more common and severe, which can cause extensive damage to forests, homes, and other
                structures. <br>
                <br>

                <b>  Water scarcity: </b> Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to droughts in some areas, which can reduce
                water availability for drinking, agriculture, and other uses. <br>
                <br>

                <b>  Displacement of people:</b> Rising sea levels and more frequent and severe weather events can force people
                to relocate from coastal areas and regions affected by droughts or other climate-related disasters. <br>
                <br>

                <b> Economic impacts on tourism:</b> Many popular tourist destinations, such as beaches and coral reefs, are
                threatened by global warming and its impacts, which can reduce tourism revenues and harm local
                economies. <br>
                <br>

                <b> Changes in ecosystems:</b> Changes in temperature and weather patterns can alter ecosystems, leading to
                changes in the distribution and abundance of species, and altering the functioning of entire ecosystems.
                <br>
                <br>

               <b> Increase in infectious diseases:</b> Global warming can create more favorable conditions for the spread of
                diseases carried by insects, such as mosquitoes and ticks, which can transmit diseases like malaria,
                dengue fever, and Lyme disease.
